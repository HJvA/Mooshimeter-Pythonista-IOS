# Mooshimeter-Pythonista-IOS
A Python 3.5 application using Bluetooth BLE interfacing with the Mooshimeter multimeter on IOS using Pythonista

The application is able to 
 - set the multimeter ranges and input channels (only fixed settings for the moment) and
 - read Voltage, Current, Resistance, Temperature and other values from the multimeter and show them (on the console crudely for the moment)

Todo
 - graphical user interface 
 - picklist for meter options

There are still some issues (who can help?)
 - there is a BADREAD diagnostics message shown
 - logging logs too much info to console
